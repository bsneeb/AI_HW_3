The one and only solution is:

Bay:          1   2   3   4   5
---------------------------------
Mechanic:   [ 1,  2,  3,  5,  4 ]
Car:        [ 3,  5,  2,  4,  1 ]

This checks out because:
- Shep can work in bay 1 on Fords
- Mona can work in bay 2 on Toyotas
- Desmond can work in bay 3 on Fords
- Wim can work in bay 4 on Hondas
- Thelma can work in bay 5 on Audis
- Mona and Wim do not work next to each other
- Desmond and Shep do not work next to each other
