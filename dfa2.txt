4) Describe the language of this DFA either in plain English or as a regex.

This DFA starts at Q0, and transitions to end state q1 through a, and end state q3 through b. Once in state q1, a can be called to stay in the end state. If b is called, it will go to q2 which is not an end state. q2 can get back to q1 through a, causing it to go back to the accept state. On q3, a can be called to get it to q4, which is not an end state. q4 can return to end state q3 through b.
